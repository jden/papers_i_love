Engelbert discusses his "bootstrapping" approach to developing augmentation systems. He talks about the challenges of starting
a purpose-driven career outside of an established discipline and the systematic approach he took to problem development and
defining a search space. He emphasized the roles of "human systems", such as language and attitudes, in addition to tools in
enhancing overall human capabilities. He ends by talking about his approach for focusing research and investment: A, core product development,
B, improving core product development capabilities, and C, improving B, the capability to improve A. He foreshadows "the next 30 years"
of work, identifying that while A might be proprietary, moving down to B and C becomes more generic, more able to be shared, and
suggest a role for consortia. Later, this is the space that would become dominated by open source technologies and organizations
like the Apache Foundation.
